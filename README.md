## 👋 Hi, I'm Paco

I'm a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Cádiz (UCA), with a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Applied Languages (UCA) and a Master's in Linguistics and Language Technologies (UCM). My main interests lie at the intersection of **Computational Linguistics**, **natural language processing (NLP)**.

🧠 I'm currently researching on **large language models (LLMs)**, exploring their linguistic competence. I also work on building practical tools for undergraduate students and linguist colleagues for them to take advantage of the NLP's best practices.

🔍 I am a researcher in the **ROBOTTALK** project, focused on detecting and characterising machine-generated texts using Forensic Linguistics principles.

🛠️ Most of my repositories are in **Python**, and often involve:
- Corpus analysis & NLP pipelines
- Linguistic resources & data processing for Spanish
- Acoustic phonetics in Praat
