## 👋 Hi, I'm Paco

I'm a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Cádiz (UCA), with a Bachelor's degree in Linguistics and Applied Languages (UCA) and a Master's in Linguistics and Language Technologies (UCM). My main interests lie at the intersection of **Computational Linguistics** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

🧠 I'm currently researching **large language models (LLMs)**, with a focus on their linguistic competence. I also develop practical tools for undergraduate students and fellow linguists to help them take advantage of best practices in NLP.

🔍 I am a researcher in the **ROBOTTALK** project, which focuses on detecting and characterizing machine-generated texts using principles from Forensic Linguistics.

🛠️ Most of my repositories are in **Python**, and often involve:
- Corpus analysis & NLP pipelines  
- Linguistic resources & data processing for Spanish  
- Acoustic phonetics using Praat
